## AI-Assisted Development Notice

This project is an experiment in AI-assisted software development, affectionately known as "vibe coding."

### What does that mean?

Ridgway Garage is built by experienced software developers who are exploring the capabilities of AI code generation tools (primarily Claude). While we bring years of professional experience to the table, a significant portion of this codebase has been generated by AI with minimal human review.

### What you should know:

- **Limited Code Review**: Much of the code has not undergone traditional peer review processes. We're trusting the AI more than we probably should.

- **Data Accuracy**: Telemetry parsing, lap time calculations, and other data processing may contain errors or inaccuracies. If your lap time looks wrong, it might actually be wrong.

- **Security**: While we've made reasonable efforts to follow security best practices, this is not a battle-tested production application. Don't use it for anything mission-critical.

- **"It works on my machine"**: The gold standard of QA around here.

### Why are we doing this?

Because it's fun, we wanted to learn, and iRacing telemetry analysis seemed like a good project to experiment with. This is a hobby project for a small racing community, not enterprise software.

### The bottom line:

Use at your own risk. We make no warranties about the accuracy, reliability, or security of this software. If your race engineer yells at you because the telemetry data was wrong, that's on you for trusting a bunch of code written by a robot and some sleep-deprived developers who thought "eh, looks right" was an acceptable review process.
